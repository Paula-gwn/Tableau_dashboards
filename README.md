Project Description:  
An interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing sales and profit performance from the Sample Superstore dataset. The dashboard highlights regional trends, product category profitability, and top-selling products.  
Key insights show that while the West drives the most sales, certain furniture sub-categories and regions report losses, pointing to opportunities to optimize pricing and discount strategies.
