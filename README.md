## Profit Margin = Profit Ã· Sales Ã— 100
It tells you what percentage of sales is left as profit after costs.  
This KPI shows the percentage of sales revenue that remains after costs. A higher margin indicates greater profitability efficiency, while a lower margin highlights areas where costs may be too high or discounts too deep.

## Project Description:  
An interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing sales and profit performance from the Sample Superstore dataset. The dashboard highlights regional trends, product category profitability, and top-selling products.  
Key insights show that while the West drives the most sales, certain furniture sub-categories and regions report losses, pointing to opportunities to optimize pricing and discount strategies.
